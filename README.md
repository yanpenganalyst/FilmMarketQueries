### FilmMarketQueries
This is a student project where I identified market opportunities for a fictitious online movie rental service by performing queries using PostgreSQL (joins, subqueries, CTEs, window functions).
### Project overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. The project aims to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.
### Key questions
The key questions answered in the project are:
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
### Data
The [dataset](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip) contains information about Rockbusterâ€™s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things.
